This programs goal is to work out the determinant of a nxn matrix using a recursive method.

Unlike for my last project, I also managed to add tests to this program which is good!

The modular nature of my code made the debugging process extremely easy.

Some improvements i can make include the following:
> provide a validity check for the inputed data (prevent letters being inputted)
>write more tests
> work out how to test input and output efficiently

ALSO LOAD THE TESTING PROGRAM WITH ./nxnMatrix (any character)
DOING ./nxnMatrix with no characters activates the program
